# Motivation

Getting up to speed with R using dose-response for 32 drugs against 6
bacterial strains.

# Tasks

1.  Plot raw OD growth curves. [Input data](doc/tasks/01_dat.csv) and
    expected [output plot](doc/tasks/01_out.pdf) are provided. The data
    is for azithromycin against *S. flexneri* M90T from day 2022-05-04
    (first replicate).

2.  Try again, now with [data](doc/tasks/02_dat.csv) from two days. In
    addition, transform the y-axis to logarithmic scale. [Expected
    output](doc/tasks/02_out.pdf).
