# Motivation

Getting up to speed with R using dose-response for 32 drugs against 6
bacterial strains.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, dpi=300, 
  fig.path = "output/fig/")
knitr::opts_knit$set(global.par = TRUE)
library('tidyverse')
```


# Tasks

In the following, we go through the most common steps in data analysis:
exploration and transformation (i.e. deriving new variables). Integral to both
steps is visualization i.e. making graphs.

## Explore

As a first look, the eploratory plots are informative and serve as a quality
control i.e. you know now that there is nothing extra suspicious goin on. Raw OD will suffice for that.

1. Plot growth curves following raw OD in time. Input
   [data](doc/tasks/01_dat.csv) and expected [output](doc/tasks/01_out.pdf)
   plot are provided. The data is for azithromycin against _S. flexneri_ M90T
   from day 2022-05-04 (first replicate). _A tip: Use `facet_wrap` with `ncol = 1` argument to have different concentrations on separate plots._

2. Try again, now with [data](doc/tasks/02_dat.csv) from two days (let us plot
   days in different color). In addition, transform the y-axis to logarithmic
   scale. Expected [output](doc/tasks/02_out.pdf). _A tip: you need to turn
   the `Date` variable into a factor._

3. Once more, now with [data](doc/tasks/03_dat.csv) from three days. Expected
   [output](doc/tasks/03_out.pdf). You will encounter an issue because there
   were two biological replicates on third day. There are multiple ways to
   overcome this, but for now, I recommend to solve by using `group` parameter 
   of `aes` e.g. `ggplot(aes(..., group = Plt))`.
